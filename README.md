# CSS Pseudo-element Overlap Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet often subtle bug in CSS: unexpected overlapping or misplacement of content generated by the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. This often occurs due to conflicts with z-index, element positioning, and layout properties (flexbox, grid).  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.

The issue typically arises when the pseudo-element's positioning or z-index isn't correctly managed within the context of the parent element and other sibling elements. 

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open `index.html` (or a similar file containing the HTML structure).
2. Observe the unexpected overlap or mispositioning of the pseudo-element's content.
3. Refer to `bugSolution.css` for the corrected approach.
