The issue is resolved by explicitly setting the `position` property of both the parent container and the pseudo-element.  Also, ensuring the correct `z-index` value is crucial to manage stacking order.  The pseudo-element should have a `z-index` greater than its siblings and parent if it needs to appear on top.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  position: relative; /* Ensures pseudo-element is positioned relative to this element */
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container::before {
  content: "Overlay";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 1; /* Ensure it's above the parent and siblings */
  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
  padding: 10px;
}
